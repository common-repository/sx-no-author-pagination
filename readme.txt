SX No author Pagination removes properly any author pagination and redirects useless paginated content.

== Description ==

With SX No author Pagination, you can easily remove properly any author pagination. It also redirects useless paginated content on author pages.

It's really usefull for SEO purposes, because it removes duplicated content on author pages.

This SEO enhancement is already included in our <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/seo-key/">**SEOKEY plugin**</a>. By ticking a simple option, the author's pagination is cleanly deleted and redirected. Better still, SEOKEY also manages old paginations that have disappeared and are generating 404 error pages, for example when you delete old content for a specific author.
